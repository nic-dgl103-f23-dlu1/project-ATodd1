    <p>“A year and a half ago I decided to take the plunge into the world of starting my own business.  The advice experienced business owners gave me was “stick to what you’re good at and hire good people to do the rest”.  Taking their advice seriously I made the right choice to go with Nicole and her team.  They worked with me every step of the way.  Whether its getting month end and payroll done on time or consulting with me on strategy and goals, Nicole and her team take pride of what they’re good at.  Nicole takes ownership of her responsibilities and plays a significant role in the success of my company.  I highly recommend Nicole for anyone that requires an accounting, bookkeeping, consulting or tax professional. Oh and she has good taste in scotch lol”</p>

Not only has she helped us sort out any issues or questions we’ve had, she’s also been proactive in making suggestions on how to improve things that hadn’t even occurred to us. We will certainly be using her services for years to come!”</p>
